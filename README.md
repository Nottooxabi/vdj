# vdj

VDJ is a program designed to automatically pull TCR sequences from low-throughput single cell sequencing experiments. While there are multiple tools for this process in the context of single cell RNA sequencing, the classic sanger sequencing assays are not well suited for these piplines. In short, text files and ab1 binary files are parsed then aligned against the imgt library, with appropiate cdr3 sequences identified.
